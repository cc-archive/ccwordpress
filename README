Creative Commons (ccpress) 3.0 Theme
2006 - Alex Roberts

FILES
 * cc3/  - theme data; place in wp-content/themes
 * plugins/* - plugins required for use; place in wp-content/plugins

INSTALLATION NOTES
 * Make sure .htaccess is writable, and update permalink structure 
   with custom string "/%category%/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/"

 * Theme relies on category structure:
   1. Blog
   3. - Lessig Letters
   4. - Featured Commoners (slug: featured-commoners)
   5. - Press
   2. Featured Content
   7. Commoners
   8. - Audio
   9. - Education
  10. - Video
  11. - Text
  12. - Education
  (This is due to old-blog import taking up cat ids 2-5, and a reshuffle
  of moving "Blog" to id 1. What's really important is making sure
  "Blog" is id 1 and "Featured Content" is id 2. If you have issue with
  that, make sure "category-1.php" is named after the Blog cat id
  number, and "category-2.php" named after the Featured Content cat id)


USAGE NOTES
 * Featured Content and Commoners require an image upload for their post.
 * Featured Content requires the url for the content peice to be in the post 
   Excerpt textarea.
 

BUGS
 * RSS feeds for Featured Content don't work properly, some hacking of the feed
   output via filters may be required.
