Creative Commons (ccpress) 3.0 Theme
2006 - Alex Roberts

FILES
 * cc3/  - theme data; place in wp-content/themes
 * plugins/* - plugins required for use; place in wp-content/plugins

INSTALLATION NOTES
 * Make sure .htaccess is writable, and update permalink structure 
   with custom string "/%category%/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/"

 * Theme relies on category structure:
   1. Blog
   3. - Lessig Letters
   4. - Featured Commoners (slug: featured-commoners)
   5. - Press
   2. Featured Content
   7. Commoners
   8. - Audio
   9. - Education
  10. - Video
  11. - Text
  12. - Education
  (This is due to old-blog import taking up cat ids 2-5, and a reshuffle
  of moving "Blog" to id 1. What's really important is making sure
  "Blog" is id 1 and "Featured Content" is id 2. If you have issue with
  that, make sure "category-1.php" is named after the Blog cat id
  number, and "category-2.php" named after the Featured Content cat id)


USAGE NOTES
 * Featured Content and Commoners require an image upload for their post.
 * Featured Content requires the url for the content peice to be in the post 
   Excerpt textarea.

NOTES ON INSTALLING ON A LOCAL MACHINE FOR TESTING
----------------------------------------------------
There may be a time when it is wise, expedient, or necessary to check out a
copy of ccwordpress in order to test something in a non-critical environment,
perhaps on your personal machine in some subdirectory of the webroot.  Here
are some pointers on getting that working.  Some things may be slightly
different depending on what you are trying to do.  There may also be other
steps that are missing here.  These are just to get you on the right path.

1) svn checkout https://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctools/ccwordpress
2) You'll need the database, so get that installed however you know to do it
3) cd ccwordpress/trunk/www && cp wp-config.php.a2 wp-config.php.  Edit as
   necessary.
4) Perform these mysql operations:
    UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '<new url>' WHERE option_name = 'siteurl';
    UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '<new url>' WHERE option_name = 'home';
5) cp -a ccwordpress/trunk/cc4 ccwordpress/trunk/www/wp-content/themes
6) Navigate to http://<siteurl>/wp-admin/.  Login, goto Presentation->Themes,
   and select the theme you just copied into the themes directory.
5) Edit ccwordpress/trunk/www/.htaccess:
    a) Set RewriteBase to the the proper (sub)dir of the webroot for your install
	b) Remove the leading slash from all RewriteRules pointing to /index.php.
	   this can be done in vi with :% s/ \/index\.php/ index\.php/g
6) Edit the file ccwordpress/trunk/www/wp-content/themes/cc4/nav.php.
   You must change the values in the $nav array to point to the correct
   places for your installation.  I found it easiest to change, for example,
   "path" => "/about/" to "path" => get_option('siteurl') . "/about/"
----------------------------------------------------

BUGS
 * RSS feeds for Featured Content don't work properly, some hacking of the feed
   output via filters may be required.
