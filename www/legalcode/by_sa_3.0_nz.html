<h3><em>License</em></h3>

<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR
GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br />

This Creative Commons New Zealand Public Licence enables You (all
capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and
distribute Works worldwide, under the terms of this licence, provided
that You credit the Original Author.<br />

<strong>'The Licensor'</strong> <br />

and<br />

<strong>'You'</strong> <br />

agree as follows:<br />

<strong>1. Definitions </strong> </p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>"Adaptation"</strong> means any work
created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the
Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collection will
not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence). For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or
sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with
a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this Licence. </li>

  <li>&ldquo;<strong>Applicable Licence</strong>&rdquo;
means one of the licences described in clause 2.3(a), (b) or (c).</li>

  <li><strong>"Attribution"</strong> means
acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and have rights
in the Work or Collection under this Licence; and
&ldquo;Attribute&rdquo; has a corresponding meaning. </li>

  <li><strong>"Collection"</strong> means the Work in
its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate
and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. </li>

  <li><strong>&ldquo;Creative Commons Compatible
Licence&rdquo; </strong>means a license that is listed at
http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this Licence,
including, at a minimum, because that licence: (i) contains terms that
have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the Licence Elements of
this Licence; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of
adaptations of works made available under that licence under this
Licence or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
Licence Elements as this Licence. </li>

  <li><strong>"Licence"</strong> means this Creative
Commons New Zealand Public Licence agreement. </li>

  <li><strong>"Licence Elements"</strong> means the
following high-level licence attributes indicated in the title of this
Licence: Attribution, Share-Alike. </li>

  <li><strong>&ldquo;Licensor&rdquo; </strong>means<strong>
    </strong>one or more legally recognised persons or entities
offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence.</li>

  <li><strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the
individual(s) or entity/ies who created the Work. </li>

  <li><strong>"Work"</strong> means the work
protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this
Licence. </li>

  <li>&ldquo;<strong>You</strong>&rdquo;
means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.</li>

  <li>For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with
the context, words in the singular number include the plural number. </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>2. Licence Terms</strong> <br />

2.1 Subject to the terms of this agreement the Licensor hereby grants
to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for use and
for the duration of copyright in the Work.<br />

<strong>You may:</strong> </p>

<ul>

  <li>copy the Work; </li>

  <li>create one or more Adaptations.&nbsp; You must take
reasonable steps to ensure any Adaptation clearly identifies that
changes were made to the original Work; </li>

  <li>incorporate the Work into one or more Collections; </li>

  <li>copy Adaptations or the Work as incorporated in any
Collection; and </li>

  <li>publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise
disseminate the Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collection, to
the public. </li>

</ul>

<p>All these rights may be exercised in any material form in any
media whether now known or hereafter created.&nbsp; All these
rights also include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>HOWEVER,</strong> <br />

<strong>You must not:</strong> </p>

<ul>

  <li>impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the
Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that alter or
restrict the terms of this Licence or the Applicable Licence, as
applicable, or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent
of restricting the ability to exercise those rights; </li>

  <li>impose any digital rights management technology on the
Work, the Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that
alters or restricts the terms of this Licence or the Applicable
Licence, as applicable, or any rights granted under it or has the
effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights; </li>

  <li>sublicense the Work; </li>

  <li>falsely Attribute the Work to someone other than the
Original Author;</li>

  <li>subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in
the Copyright Act 1994 provided that if the Licensor is the Original
Author the Licensor will not enforce this sub-clause to the extent
necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under clause
2.1 to make Adaptations but not otherwise. </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>FINALLY,</strong> <br />

<strong>You must:</strong> </p>

<ul>

  <li>make reference to this Licence or the Applicable Licence,
as applicable, (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as
appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work, Adaptations
and Collections published, distributed, performed or otherwise
disseminated or made available to the public by You; </li>

  <li>recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of
Attribution (right to be identified) in any Work, Adaptation and
Collection that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise
disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the Licensor /
Original Author as appropriate to the media used.&nbsp; You will
however remove such a credit if requested by the Licensor/Original
Author; </li>

  <li>not assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
endorsement by the Original Author or Licensor of You or Your use of
the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the
Original Author or Licensor; and </li>

  <li>to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all
notices that refer to this Licence or the Applicable Licence, as
applicable, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Additional Provisions</strong> <br />

2.2. Further licence from the Licensor<br />

Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate</p>

<ul>

  <li>the Work; or </li>

  <li>any Adaptation; or </li>

  <li>the Work as incorporated in a Collection </li>

</ul>

<p>the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party
making use of the Work (&ldquo;User&rdquo;) (in any of the
alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on the same terms
and conditions as granted to You hereunder.<br />

2.3. Further licence from You<br />

Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate</p>

<ul>

  <li>an Adaptation; or </li>

  <li>an Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection </li>

</ul>

<p>You agree to offer to the User (in either of the alternatives
set out above) a licence to use the Adaptation on any of the following
premises and to comply with such licence:<br />

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a licence to the Adapt0ation on the same terms and conditions as the
licence granted to You hereunder; or <br />

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a later version of the licence granted to You hereunder; <br />

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
any other Creative Commons licence (whether the Unported or a
jurisdiction licence) with the same Licence Elements; or&nbsp;<br />

(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a Creative Commons Compatible Licence. </p>

<p>2.4. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may
have under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any
other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright
infringement.<br />

2.5. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby
reserved.<br />

2.6. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or via a licensing body such as a collecting society, for
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.<br />

2.7. If the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor waives its
moral right to object to derogatory treatments of the Work to the
extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under
this License to make Adaptations but not otherwise.&nbsp; If the
Licensor is not the Original Author the Work will still be subject to
the moral rights of the Original Author.<br />

<strong>3. Warranties and Disclaimer</strong> <br />

Except as required by law or as otherwise agreed in writing between the
parties, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and "as
available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express
or implied.<br />

<strong>4. Limit of Liability</strong> <br />

Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law
the Licensor shall not be liable on any legal basis (including without
limitation negligence) and hereby expressly excludes all liability for
loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.<br />

<strong>5. Termination</strong> <br />

The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those Licences.&nbsp; Clauses 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will
survive any termination of this Licence.<br />

<strong>6. General</strong> <br />

6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this
agreement is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be
invalid or unenforceable.<br />

6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the
parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work
not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
provisions that may appear in any communication in any form.<br />

6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights
under the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 to enforce any of its terms.<br />

<strong>7. On the role of Creative Commons</strong> <br />

7.1. Creative Commons does not authorise either the Licensor or the
User to use the trade mark &ldquo;Creative Commons&rdquo; or
any related trade mark, including the Creative Commons logo, except to
indicate that the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons
trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons
trade mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons
website or be otherwise available upon request from time to
time.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt this trade mark restriction
does not form part of this Licence.<br />

7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its
role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of
any Licensor or user of the Licence.<br />

7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires
of the Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and
agreement by all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not
responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the
Licensor or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence.</p>
