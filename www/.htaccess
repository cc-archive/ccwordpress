# Please add copious comments to any new rule. Better to fill this document
# with comments and know what is happening than try to figure out what
# some obscure rule is for down the road.

# NOTE: sometimes Wordpress decides what page to display based on both the
# query string AND the REQUEST_URI.  mod_rewrite does not alter the
# REQUEST_URI, and therefore mod_rewrite by itself is not always enough to
# coerce Wordpress into doing what we want.  In these case, add the query
# argument '&roflcopter' to whatever RewriteRule.  This will signal a special
# plugin (cc_rewrite_request_uri.php) to actually alter the REQUEST_URI in the
# PHP environment to be equivalent to the right side of the RewriteRule.
